"""#2973 — save_semantic_cache must recover a group whose reported
source_file never resolves to a real file, by an unambiguous basename match
against the already dispatched allowlist, instead of silently dropping it.

A weak or local backend's adaptive-retry split path (llm.py bisecting a
chunk that overflowed context and retrying) sometimes re-prompts with a
reduced file subset and loses track of which of the original chunk's files
a given node came from, so its source_file drifts to something that never
resolves at all. Without recovery this silently discarded the group's nodes
and edges from the cache on every incremental run.
